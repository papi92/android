AndroidOpenDevelopment
===========

AndroidOpenDevelopment is meant to be an AOSP/CAF base with hardware support for various OEM chipsets
such as QCOM OMAP Tegra, etc, without any additional feature support.

It is hoped that various community ROMs will submit patches from upstream sources for basic hardware
support eliminating the need for each ROM to do all the extra work, thereby bringing COMMUNITY back
to android
